# ADAS Sensor Fusion and Object Detection System

## Overview
This implementation demonstrates a comprehensive Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that integrates computer vision, machine learning, and sensor fusion techniques to detect and respond to potential road hazards.

## System Architecture

### Key Components
1. **Object Detection Module**
   - Utilizes pre-trained YOLOv3 model
   - Processes camera input
   - Identifies multiple object classes

2. **Radar Simulation Module**
   - Generates synthetic radar data
   - Provides distance and velocity information
   - Simulates sensor characteristics

3. **Sensor Fusion Engine**
   - Correlates camera and radar data
   - Cross-validates object detection
   - Enhances detection accuracy

4. **Risk Assessment System**
   - Calculates collision probabilities
   - Classifies risk levels
   - Triggers appropriate safety mechanisms

## Key Methods

### `preprocess_camera_image()`
- Resizes input image
- Applies object detection
- Returns detected objects with confidence scores

### `simulate_radar_data()`
- Generates simulated radar measurements

- Introduces realistic sensor noise and variation

### `sensor_fusion()`
- Combines camera and radar data
- Validates object detection across sensors
- Creates comprehensive object representations

### `collision_risk_assessment()`
- Calculates risk based on:
  - Object distance
  - Relative velocity
  - Object type
- Categorizes risks: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

### `trigger_safety_mechanisms()`
- Recommends safety actions based on risk level
- Supports actions like:
  - Emergency braking
  - Driver alerts
  - Adaptive cruise control interventions
